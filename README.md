# 100 Days, 100 Datasets Challenge

Welcome to my **100 Days, 100 Datasets Challenge**! In this project, I am exploring a new dataset every day for 100 days to enhance my data analysis and visualization skills. This repository contains my work for each dataset, including code, analysis, and visualizations.

## Day 3: Iris Dataset

### Overview

On Day 3, I explored the **Iris Dataset**, a classic dataset in data science used for classification tasks. It includes measurements of iris flowers from three different species. The dataset is widely used for practicing machine learning algorithms and performing exploratory data analysis (EDA).

### Dataset Description

The Iris dataset consists of the following features:

- `sepal_length`: Sepal length in centimeters
- `sepal_width`: Sepal width in centimeters
- `petal_length`: Petal length in centimeters
- `petal_width`: Petal width in centimeters
- `species`: Species of iris flower (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica)

### Analysis and Visualizations

In this analysis, I performed the following:

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Checked for missing values
   - Computed basic statistics for each feature
   - Grouped data by species and analyzed descriptive statistics

2. **Data Visualization:**
   - Distribution plots for sepal length and width
   - Pair plot to visualize relationships between features
   - Box plots to compare feature distributions across species
   - Correlation heatmap to identify feature correlations

3. **Statistical Analysis:**
   - Performed correlation analysis
   - Detected outliers using the Interquartile Range (IQR) method

### Getting Started

To run the analysis and view the visualizations, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/100-days-100-datasets.git
Navigate to the Project Directory:

bash
Copy code
cd 100-days-100-datasets
Install Required Libraries:

Make sure you have pandas, numpy, seaborn, and matplotlib installed. You can install them using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install pandas numpy seaborn matplotlib
Run the Analysis Script:

Execute the Jupyter Notebook or Python script for Day 3:

bash
Copy code
jupyter notebook day_3_iris_dataset.ipynb
or

bash
Copy code
python day_3_iris_dataset.py
